# Advanced Facial Recognition & Spoof Detection System

An advanced AI-powered system that combines **facial recognition** with **spoof detection and liveness verification** to accurately identify users and prevent spoofing attacks (e.g., photos, masks, or video replays). This project is designed with a focus on **deep learning**, **computer vision**, **model optimization**, and **deployment on edge devices**.

---

## Project Overview

This system goes beyond traditional facial recognition by integrating **spoof detection**, enabling it to distinguish between real human faces and presentation attacks. It leverages powerful **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **temporal analysis techniques** to ensure the system is both accurate and robust in real-world conditions.

We use the **CelebA** dataset for facial identity learning and the **Spoof in the Wild** dataset to train the model to detect spoofed inputs. Our end goal is to **optimize the model for edge deployment** using **ONNX**, and expose it as a real-time service via **FastAPI**.
